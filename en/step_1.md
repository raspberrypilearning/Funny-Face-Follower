## Introduction

In this project, you will use machine learning to do facial recognition! You will use a different version of Scratch (what programmers call a ‘fork’) that is pre-made with special extensions created by Machine Learning for Kids.

### What you will make

--- no-print ---
In this project, you will use a cloud-based machine learning engine called IBM Watson (with Scratch!) to create a project that will recognise your face in the webcam and place some funny sprites over it to make a mask that follows you!
