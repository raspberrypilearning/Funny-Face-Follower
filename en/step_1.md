## Introduction

Today, you’re going to be using a different version of Scratch (what programmers call a ‘fork’) that is pre-made with special Extensions created by IBM. Today, you're going to use machine learning to do facial recognition! 

### What you will make

--- no-print ---
In this activity, you will use a cloud-based machine learning engine called Watson (with Scratch!) to create a project that will recognise your face in the webcam and place some funny sprites over it to make a mask that follows you!
