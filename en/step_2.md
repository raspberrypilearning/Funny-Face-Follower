## Facial recognition with Scratch

For this activity, we’re going to use a special version of Scratch created for just this reason! You can open this special fork of Scratch any time by following [this link](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/scratch3/){:target="_blank"} to make your own machine learning projects.

Once you’ve followed the link above, you should be able to see a brand new, empty Scratch project, just like you're used to - the cool part comes when we add some new Extensions that are included in this fork of Scratch. The two extensions we want to enable are Video Sensing and Facial Recognition.

Unfortunately, because this version of Scratch is a bit different to the normal one - if you want to be able to save your work, you’ll need to download your project to your computer and re-open it in the special version of Scratch when you want to use it again.

If working **online**, open the [starter project](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/scratch3/){:target="_blank"} in Scratch.
 
As this project requires connection to the cloud based machine learning engine, offline work is not possible.
