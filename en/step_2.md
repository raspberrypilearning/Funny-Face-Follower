## Step title

In this activity, you will use the amazing online machine learning engine based off of IBM’s artificial intelligence project (called Watson) and Scratch to create a project that will recognise your face in the webcam and place some funny sprites over it to make a mask that follows you!

For this activity, we’re going to use a [special version of Scratch](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/scratch3/){:target="_blank"} created specially for machine learning! Unfortunately, because this version of Scratch is a bit different to the normal one - if you want to be able to save your work, you’ll need to download your project to your computer and re-open it in the special version of Scratch when you want to use it again.

If working **online**, open the [starter project](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/scratch3/){:target="_blank"} in Scratch.
 
As this project requires connection to the cloud based machine learning engine, offline work is not possible.
